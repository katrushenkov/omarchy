-- Define terminal tag so themes and bindings can single terminals out. Omarchy
-- launches TUIs and its own terminal windows under dedicated app-ids
-- (org.omarchy.btop, org.omarchy.terminal, TUI.float, ...), so match those too.
-- foot-dropterm is the app-id pypr's scratchpad terminal launches under.
-- The class is matched in full, so foot's other app-ids need spelling out.
